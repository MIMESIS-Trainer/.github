## Overview

MIMESIS focuses on three practical categories: resource permanence (ammo/durability), economy control (currency), and workflow (profiles + macros). The tool is designed to be unobtrusive — the overlay only appears when you need it and supports layered configs to suit different titles or builds.

### Quick snapshot

* Real-time toggles with hotkeys
* Exportable `.mimprofile` config files
* Lightweight overlay (DirectX/Vulkan friendly)
* Admin/diagnostic logging for reproducible testing

## Advanced Usage & Tips

* **Layered Profiles:** Combine a base profile (shared toggles) with game-specific overlays to keep settings tidy.
* **Safe Test Mode:** Use `Diagnostic Mode` to preview value changes without committing them — great for troubleshooting.
* **Macro Sequences:** Create an auto-replenish macro to restore durability every X minutes for longer tests.
* **Export/Import:** Share `.mimprofile` configs with the team for consistent QA setups.

## FAQ

**Q: Are these changes permanent in save files?**
A: No — by default MIMESIS operates on memory/runtime values. Some games persist changes to save files depending on how they handle memory writes; always back up saves before experimenting.

**Q: Will this get me banned in online multiplayer?**
A: Using trainers in multiplayer is risky and typically against service terms. MIMESIS is intended for single-player, local testing, and mod-enabled sessions. Use discretion.

**Q: How do I revert changes quickly?**
A: Toggle the feature off or use the profile reset command. The overlay also includes a one-click Restore Defaults option.

**Q: What if my game updates and MIMESIS fails to attach?**
A: Switch to Diagnostic Mode to get suggested offsets, or load an updated profile. The development channel provides frequent offset patches for major titles.

**Q: Can I automate currency changes?**
A: Yes — use the Auto-Sequence Engine to schedule periodic currency adjustments or bind values to hotkeys.
